## Portfolio website 

This website gathers different projects in different programming languages that I have created so far. It is composed by a Home page with all the information about me and what I do, a Projects page with all the projects I created and an About page in which you can contact me in case you need. The website is made mostly using Typescript, with different simple components in other programming languages.
